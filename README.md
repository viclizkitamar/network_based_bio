## Introduction

This repository contains the code and documentation for my thesis project titled "Network based biocomputation." The project explores the application of biological network concepts to address computationally challenging problems within the class of NP-complete problems.

## Objective

The main objective of this thesis is to investigate the effectiveness of leveraging biological network structures and algorithms to find efficient solutions to NP-complete problems. By combining principles from computational biology and theoretical computer science, the project aims to contribute novel insights into solving complex problems.

## Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (version 3.8.10)
- [Env](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/viclizkitamar/thesis.git
